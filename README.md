## 💡 ComfyUI-Aware. ComfyUI-Independent.

SmartGallery DAM runs as a fully independent process, outside ComfyUI's environment. It keeps indexing and organizing your library whether ComfyUI is up, down, updating, or completely uninstalled. No custom node, no shared dependencies.

SmartGallery DAM is *ComfyUI-aware* (it reads workflows, extracts prompts, understands models and LoRAs) but *ComfyUI-independent* by design. Your DAM outlives any tool it connects to.

**What this means in practice:**

- ComfyUI is broken after a Python update? SmartGallery keeps running.
- Run it alongside ComfyUI on the same machine on a different port. Or install it on a separate machine or laptop and just link the output folder over the network.
- You switched tools entirely? SmartGallery works on *any* folder of media. It was never ComfyUI-only to begin with.

## 1. OVERVIEW & CONCEPTS

### 1.1 What is SmartGallery DAM?

**SmartGallery DAM** is the evolution of *SmartGallery for ComfyUI*. What started as a fast local gallery for browsing outputs has grown into a powerful and easy-to-use **Digital Asset Management system**. 

Evolve your workflow from a simple collection of files into a structured, searchable library. Designed for individual creators and professional teams, this platform is ridiculously simple to use, yet powerful enough to act as the ultimate file manager for your generations. Every asset is automatically indexed, linked to its original generative parameters, and ready for secure review. The system is open-source, private, and entirely local: no cloud dependencies and no recurring costs.

**Who is this for?**

- **The AI Artist & Creator.** You run ComfyUI all day. Your output folder has tens of thousands of files and you can never find anything. SmartGallery lives outside that chaos. It indexes every generation with its full workflow, groups variations automatically using Smart Asset Clustering (`Shift+C`), lets you search by prompt, model, or LoRA with live auto-suggest, and lets you cull while batches are still running. When ComfyUI breaks, SmartGallery doesn't even blink.
- **The Creative Pro or Team.** You deliver AI visuals to clients. Sharing via Google Drive or Dropbox feels unprofessional. SmartGallery gives you Production Briefs (`.md`/`.txt`) attached to collections, status tags, and an optional Exhibition portal where clients rate and comment on images in real time, while your prompts and workflows stay completely invisible to them.
- **Everyone else.** You just want to organize photos, videos, or art and share them nicely. SmartGallery works with any folder on your system.  
- **The Remote or Multi-Machine User.** You want your gallery on a dedicated machine (a laptop, a NAS, a home server) without installing ComfyUI there. Install SmartGallery on that machine, link your ComfyUI output folder over the network, and access the full DAM from any browser, on any device, including your phone.

### 1.2 What's New in v2.22

- 📁 **Folder File Count Badges & Dynamic Tree Collapse**: Folder navigation now features real-time file count badges across the entire directory tree in both the main sidebar and file management dialogs. 
- **Direct & Subfolder File Counts:** Displays a badge for files directly contained within a folder. When a parent folder is collapsed, a secondary `+N` badge automatically appears to indicate the combined file count of all its nested subfolders.  
- 🐛 **Bug Fixes & Stability**: Fixed Batch File Move & Copy Operations. Resolved a backend exception that in v2.21 caused file relocation and copying between folders to fail. 

---

- 🧬 [**Smart Asset Clustering & Visual Inspector (`Shift+C`)**](docs/Smart_Asset_Clustering_manual.md): Instantly group and compare media generated by identical ComfyUI graph architectures (`workflow_hash`) or identical positive prompts (`prompt_hash`). Click any colorful `#HASH` badge to open the interactive **Cluster Inspector** to view node pipeline chains, loaded model inventories, and launch one-click cluster searches. 👉 READ the **[Smart Asset Clustering Manual](docs/Smart_Asset_Clustering_manual.md)**.

### 1.4 Use Case Scenarios

SmartGallery has two interfaces: the **Main Interface** (your personal workspace) and **Exhibition** (an optional sharing portal for clients, collaborators, or friends). They are completely independent. You can run just the Main Interface forever and never touch Exhibition. You can launch Exhibition only when you have something to share and shut it down when the review is over. Neither requires the other to be running.

<details>
<summary><strong>Scenario 1: Solo user, no sharing needed (upgrading from v1)</strong></summary>

If you used SmartGallery v1 as an advanced file manager and have no need to share your work, nothing changes. Launch it exactly as before, with no extra parameters:

```bash
python smartgallery.py
```

ComfyUI is generating hundreds of files. As each one appears in the grid, you decide in real time: delete the bad seeds immediately with `Del`, move the keepers to the right folder with `M`, mark favorites with `F`, or tag them with a color status. You do all of this while generation is still running. When you want to review later, you search by prompt keywords, model name, or LoRA, pull up the full node summary for any image from months ago, or compare two generations side by side with a parameter diff.

When ComfyUI is not running, the same interface works as a full file manager for all your media. No Exhibition needed, ever, unless you decide you want it.

What is new in v2 that you can start using immediately, with no additional setup:

-   **Virtual Collections:** group files from different folders into named albums without moving anything on disk. Open the Collections tab in the left sidebar and click + to create one.
-   **Status Tags:** mark any image with a workflow state using keys `1` to `5`. For example, press `3` to flag a file as "To Edit" and come back to it later. Browse all files with a given status from the Status tab in the sidebar.
-   **Ratings and personal notes:** press `G` on any image to open the Details panel. Assign a 1 to 5 star rating and write a note to yourself. These notes are searchable: use the comment keyword filter to find any image by words you wrote in your own comments.
-   **Clean Export:** to send a file to someone without exposing your ComfyUI workflow and models, press `Shift+W`. You get a pixel-perfect copy with all metadata stripped.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Scenario 2: Sharing your work with Exhibition</strong></summary>

Exhibition is a separate, read-only portal you share with clients, collaborators, or anyone you want to show your work to.

**Step 1: Launch the Main Interface with authentication.**

> The line below shows only the launch command with the relevant parameters. In practice you should add these parameters to your platform launch script (the `.bat` or `.sh` file you created during installation), which also sets your folder paths and ffprobe location. If you have not created a launch script yet, see the [Installation](#21-installation) section, pick your platform, and follow the instructions there first.

```bash
python smartgallery.py --port 8189 --admin-pass yourpassword --force-login
```

Log in at `http://localhost:8189` with username `admin` (always lowercase) and the password you set above.

**Step 2: Create Collections and set Permissions.** In the left sidebar, open the Collections tab and click +. Give each collection a name. You can toggle it as "Exhibition Ready" (public for everyone in the portal), or click the `⋮` menu -> 👥 **Share / Permissions** to assign it exclusively to a specific client.

**Step 3: Create user accounts.** Click the user management icon in the sidebar. Create an account for each person who will access Exhibition. For clients and external viewers, assign the role CUSTOMER or USER. Share their credentials and the Exhibition URL with them directly.

**Step 4: Launch Exhibition.**

> Same as above: add these parameters to a second launch script for Exhibition (a separate `.bat` or `.sh` file), keeping your folder paths and other settings identical to the Main Interface script. Run it from a second terminal when you are ready to share.

```bash
python smartgallery.py --exhibition --port 8190 --admin-pass yourpassword
```

Share `http://youraddress:8190` with your users. They will see only the collections assigned to them, with no prompts, no workflow data, and no folder structure. They can leave star ratings and write comments on individual images. You can read and reply to their feedback from the Main Interface at any time.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Scenario 3: Small team working together (Blind Rating)</strong></summary>

The team lead runs the Main Interface with `--force-login` and `--admin-pass` so the workspace is password-protected. Each team member gets a STAFF account and logs into the same Main Interface remotely to review files, apply status tags, and leave internal comments on specific images.

```bash
python smartgallery.py --port 8189 --admin-pass yourpassword --force-login
```

When work is ready for a client, a CUSTOMER account is created, the relevant Collections are mapped, and Exhibition is launched on a separate port. To prevent the client (or team members) from being influenced by what others voted, the lead launches Exhibition with the `--blind-rating` flag:

```bash
python smartgallery.py --exhibition --port 8190 --admin-pass yourpassword --blind-rating
```

Now, when clients log into `http://youraddress:8190`, they cannot see the global average score. They only see their own stars. Admins reviewing the gallery can press `B` to toggle the blind mode off temporarily and see the real consensus. 

All feedback runs through the same database, with no file transfers, no email threads, and no ZIP files.

## 2. SETUP & CONFIGURATION

### 2.1 Installation

**Requirements:**
*   **Portable/Docker Installation:** No installation required. Everything is pre-configured (Python is already embedded).
*   **Manual Installation:** Python 3.11+ installed on your system.
*   **Strongly Recommended:** FFmpeg/FFprobe (for advanced video features).

<details>
<summary><strong>Windows Installation Guide</strong></summary>

There are two ways to run SmartGallery on Windows: using the ready-to-use **Portable Version** (Recommended) or the **Manual Git Installation**.

---

### Method 1: Portable Version (Recommended)
This version includes a fully self-contained environment. You do not need to install Python or any dependencies on your system—it is **completely plug-and-play**.

**1. Download & Extract**
* **Direct Download:** [SmartGallery-v2.22-Windows-Portable.zip](https://github.com/biagiomaf/smart-comfyui-gallery/releases/download/2.22/SmartGallery-v2.22-Windows-Portable.zip)
* **Releases Page:** Alternatively, view all builds on the [Releases page](https://github.com/biagiomaf/smart-comfyui-gallery/releases/latest).
* Extract the archive into a folder of your choice.

**2. Configure and Run**
* **Read First:** Before launching, open the `00_START_HERE.txt` file included in the root folder for essential setup instructions.
* **Customize:** Rename `sample_run_smartgallery.bat` to `run_smartgallery.bat`, right-click it, and select **Edit**.
* **Setup Paths:** Update the `CONFIGURATION` section to point to your specific ComfyUI folders. Write the paths however you like — backslashes, forward slashes, a trailing slash or the quotes Explorer adds are all normalised.
* **Launch:** Save the file and double-click `run_smartgallery.bat` to launch the server!

**3. Updating to a Newer Version**
To update to a newer release while preserving your settings:
1. Download and extract the new Portable ZIP into a fresh folder.
2. Simply copy your existing `run_smartgallery.bat` (and any custom `.bat` files for Exhibition Mode) into the new folder.
3. Launch your copied `.bat` file; your configuration will be preserved automatically.

*Note: SmartGallery DAM is completely standalone; your database and settings are kept safe in your chosen configuration path.*

---

### Method 2: Manual / Git Installation
For advanced users who prefer managing their own Python virtual environments and updating via Git.

**1. Clone and setup**

```bat
git clone https://github.com/biagiomaf/smart-comfyui-gallery
cd smart-comfyui-gallery
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or download the Source Code ZIP from [Releases](https://github.com/biagiomaf/smart-comfyui-gallery/releases/latest), extract, and run the pip commands above.

**Alternative: [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** — the repository ships a `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`, so one command creates the environment and installs locked dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/biagiomaf/smart-comfyui-gallery
cd smart-comfyui-gallery
uv sync                        # everything (app + AI runtimes, CPU torch) into ./.venv
uv run python smartgallery.py  # run the gallery
```

Everything is included by default — the AI layer is core, not an optional group. Runtime packages are never installed at runtime; they come from `uv sync`, or from `requirements.txt` for pip users. Model **weights** download only when a job that needs them asks — see `docs/AI_MODELS.md`.

**2. Create your launch script**

Create `run_smartgallery.bat` in the root folder:

```bat
@echo off
cd /d %~dp0
call venv\Scripts\activate.bat

:: --- CONFIGURATION: replace with your real paths ---
:: Backslashes or forward slashes, both fine

<summary><strong>Docker & Unraid Setup Guide</strong></summary>

> Special thanks to [Martial Michel (@mmartial)](https://github.com/mmartial) for orchestrating Docker support and contributing to the core application logic.

Pre-built image on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mmartial/smart-comfyui-gallery) and **Unraid Community Apps**.

![Unraid CA](assets/smart-comfyui-gallery-unraidCA.png)

**Run:**

```bash
docker run \
  --name smartgallery \
  -v /your/host/output:/mnt/output \
  -v /your/host/input:/mnt/input \
  -v /your/host/SmartGallery:/mnt/SmartGallery \
  -e BASE_OUTPUT_PATH=/mnt/output \
  -e BASE_INPUT_PATH=/mnt/input \
  -e BASE_SMARTGALLERY_PATH=/mnt/SmartGallery \
  -e WANTED_UID=`id -u` \
  -e WANTED_GID=`id -g` \
  # -e CLI_ARGS="..."   # Optional: add launch parameters here (see below) \
  -p 8189:8189 \
  mmartial/smart-comfyui-gallery
```

The `CLI_ARGS` environment variable passes optional launch parameters to SmartGallery inside the container. Add it to the command above depending on your scenario:

| Scenario | CLI_ARGS value | Port mapping |
|---|---|---|
| Main Interface with login | `--force-login` | `-p 8189:8189` |
| Exhibition | `--exhibition` | `-p 8190:8189` |
| Exhibition with guest access | `--exhibition --enable-guest-login` | `-p 8190:8189` |
| Exhibition with Blind Rating | `--exhibition --blind-rating` | `-p 8190:8189` |

Set the password with its own variable, `-e ADMIN_PASSWORD=yourpassword`, rather than putting `--admin-pass` inside `CLI_ARGS`. `CLI_ARGS` is split on spaces before it reaches the gallery, so a passphrase such as `correct horse battery` would arrive as `correct` and you would not be able to log in with what you set.

For Exhibition scenarios, replace `-p 8189:8189` in the `docker run` command above with `-p 8190:8189`. This maps port 8190 on your host to the container's internal port 8189, so clients reach Exhibition at `http://youraddress:8190`.

Log in with username `admin` (always lowercase) and the password you set.

For running both instances simultaneously, see the dedicated section under [Launch Parameters](#22-launch-parameters).

**Update:**

```bash
docker pull mmartial/smart-comfyui-gallery
docker stop smartgallery && docker rm smartgallery
# Re-run the docker run command above
```

Once installed, open SmartGallery at:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8189/galleryout
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **When you update to a new version:**
> 
> * **For Portable Installations:** Simply download the new version, extract it, and overwrite your existing files. Remember to **keep your existing launch scripts** (`.bat` or `.sh` files) to preserve your custom paths and settings.
> * **For Docker Installations:** Pull the latest image and restart your container. Your configuration is preserved via your volume mappings.
> * **For Manual Installations:** Remember to keep your existing launch scripts (`.bat` or `.sh` files). After updating your files, refresh your environment dependencies by running: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### 2.2 Launch Parameters

The Main Interface and Exhibition are completely independent. You can run just one, both at the same time, or alternate between them. Neither requires the other to be running.

<details>
<summary><strong>Main Interface parameters</strong></summary>

All parameters are optional. Launched with no flags, SmartGallery runs on port 8189 and treats you as admin automatically when accessed from a local network.

| Flag | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--port <number>` | Optional | Override the default port (8189). |
| `--admin-pass <pwd>` | Optional* | Set the Admin password. Required to enable user management. Minimum 8 characters. Log in with username `admin` (always lowercase) and the password you set here. |
| `--force-login` | Optional* | Enforces authentication. Must always be combined with `--admin-pass`. Use when accessing from outside the local network. |
| `--blind-rating` | Optional | Forces Blind Rating mode. Useful if you want team members in the main UI to vote without bias. |

`*` `--admin-pass` and `--force-login` must be used together when either is specified.

> **Accessing the main interface from outside your local network?** Always use `--admin-pass` and `--force-login` together, without exception. Without these two flags the interface is open to anyone who finds the URL.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Exhibition parameters</strong></summary>

| Flag | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--exhibition` | Yes | Start in Exhibition Mode. Only assigned or public collections are visible. Physical folder browsing is disabled. |
| `--admin-pass <pwd>` | Yes | Set the Admin password. Required to protect the instance and enable user management. Minimum 8 characters. |
| `--port <number>` | Yes | Use a different port when running Exhibition alongside the main interface. Typically 8190. |
| `--enable-guest-login` | Optional | Shows a "Login as Guest" button. No account needed to browse Exhibition. |
| `--blind-rating` | Optional | **Blind Rating Mode.** Hides global average ratings from the UI. Users see and sort only by their own personal ratings, ensuring unbiased curation feedback from clients and guests. |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Running both instances: together or independently</strong></summary>

The two instances can run at the same time from two separate terminals or scripts, or independently whenever needed. Launch Exhibition only when you have something to share. There is no requirement to keep both running permanently.

**Python: two terminals or scripts**

```bash
# Terminal 1: Main interface
python smartgallery.py --port 8189 --admin-pass yourpassword --force-login

# Terminal 2: Exhibition (launch only when needed, with Blind Rating active)
python smartgallery.py --exhibition --port 8190 --admin-pass yourpassword --blind-rating
```

**Docker: same image, launched twice**

```bash
# Main interface container (port 8189 on host)
docker run --name smartgallery-main \
  -v /your/host/output:/mnt/output \
  -v /your/host/input:/mnt/input \
  -v /your/host/SmartGallery:/mnt/SmartGallery \
  -e BASE_OUTPUT_PATH=/mnt/output \
  -e BASE_INPUT_PATH=/mnt/input \
  -e BASE_SMARTGALLERY_PATH=/mnt/SmartGallery \
  -e WANTED_UID=`id -u` \
  -e WANTED_GID=`id -g` \
  -e ADMIN_PASSWORD=yourpassword \
  -e CLI_ARGS="--force-login" \
  -p 8189:8189 \
  mmartial/smart-comfyui-gallery

# Exhibition container (port 8190 on host)
docker run --name smartgallery-exhibition \
  -v /your/host/output:/mnt/output \
  -v /your/host/input:/mnt/input \
  -v /your/host/SmartGallery:/mnt/SmartGallery \
  -e BASE_OUTPUT_PATH=/mnt/output \
  -e BASE_INPUT_PATH=/mnt/input \
  -e BASE_SMARTGALLERY_PATH=/mnt/SmartGallery \
  -e WANTED_UID=`id -u` \
  -e WANTED_GID=`id -g` \
  -e ADMIN_PASSWORD=yourpassword \
  -e CLI_ARGS="--exhibition --blind-rating" \
  -p 8190:8189 \
  mmartial/smart-comfyui-gallery
```

Docker port mapping: the syntax is `HOST:CONTAINER`. Both containers run internally on port 8189, but are reachable at `:8189` and `:8190` respectively on your machine. They share the same data volumes, so files, tags, and collections are visible in both.

</details>

### 2.3 FFmpeg Integration

FFmpeg is optional but strongly recommended. Without it, video files will not generate thumbnails, the storyboard feature will not work, and formats like ProRes, MKV, AVI, and MOV will not transcode for browser playback.

If you only work with images, you can skip this entirely.

<details>
<summary><strong>What FFmpeg enables</strong></summary>

-   Thumbnail generation for MP4, WEBM, and all transcoded formats
-   Video Storyboard: the 11-frame grid preview (`E` key in the Lightbox)
-   Interactive Audio Waveforms (`GENERATE_WAVEFORMS=true`)
-   On-the-fly transcoding of ProRes, MKV, AVI, MOV to a browser-compatible format
-   Workflow extraction from video files generated by ComfyUI

SmartGallery uses `ffprobe` (included in every FFmpeg installation) to read video metadata, and `ffmpeg` itself for transcoding. You point SmartGallery to the `ffprobe` binary via the `FFPROBE_MANUAL_PATH` variable in your launch script.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Install FFmpeg on Windows</strong></summary>

1.  Download a pre-built release from [ffmpeg.org/download.html](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) (the "Windows builds" section, for example from gyan.dev or BtbN).
2.  Extract the archive to a permanent location, for example `C:/ffmpeg`.
3.  The binaries you need are inside the `bin` folder: `ffmpeg.exe` and `ffprobe.exe`.
4.  In your `run_smartgallery.bat`, set:

```bat
set "FFPROBE_MANUAL_PATH=C:/ffmpeg/bin/ffprobe.exe"
```

You do not need to add FFmpeg to your system PATH. SmartGallery only needs the full path to `ffprobe.exe`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Install FFmpeg on macOS</strong></summary>

The easiest way is Homebrew:

```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

After installation, ffprobe will typically be at `/opt/homebrew/bin/ffprobe` (Apple Silicon) or `/usr/local/bin/ffprobe` (Intel). Set it in your launch script:

```bash
export FFPROBE_MANUAL_PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin/ffprobe"
```

To confirm the path on your machine: `which ffprobe`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Install FFmpeg on Linux</strong></summary>

On Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

On Fedora/RHEL:

```bash
sudo dnf install ffmpeg
```

ffprobe is installed alongside ffmpeg. The default path is usually `/usr/bin/ffprobe`. Set it in your launch script:

```bash
export FFPROBE_MANUAL_PATH="/usr/bin/ffprobe"
```

To confirm: `which ffprobe`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Docker: nothing to install</strong></summary>

The official Docker image (`mmartial/smart-comfyui-gallery`) already includes FFmpeg and ffprobe. Video transcoding, thumbnail generation, and storyboard creation all work out of the box with no additional configuration.

### 3.1.1 Sidebar Navigation

The left sidebar contains three main tabs:  

![Sidebar with three tabs: Folders, Collections, Status](assets/sidebar_tabs.png)

*The three-tab sidebar: Folders (directory tree), Collections (virtual albums), Status (browse by pipeline state).*

-   **📁 Folders (Physical):** Browse actual folders on your hard drive.
    -   `+` — Create a subfolder
    -   🔗 — Mount an external drive or network folder via symlink
    -   `⋮` — Rename, Delete, Unmount, or force AI Indexing on a folder
-   **📚 Collections (Virtual):** Virtual albums grouping files from different folders without moving them on disk. Collections with attached **Collection Notes** feature a distinct **yellow accent**.
-   **🏷 Status:** Browse all files by their color-coded pipeline status across every folder at once.
-   **👤 User Profile (bottom):** Shows your current role. Click 👥 to open User Management, `×` to log out.

---

### 3.1.2 Top Toolbar & Global Actions

![Top toolbar with Filters, Upload, Rescan, Refresh buttons and sort options](assets/top_main_toolbar.png)

*The top toolbar: action buttons on the left, file count and sort options on the right.*

-   **🛠️ Tools:** Opens tools menu including **🧬 Smart Clustering**, Remix Workflow, and ComfyUI launcher.
-   **⚙️ Options:** Global settings — thumbnail size (Normal 320px / Compact 220px), video autoplay, and **🧬 Cluster Badges** toggle.
-   **? Shortcuts:** Full keyboard shortcut list for the current interface.
-   **⚡ Focus (Q):** Toggle Focus Mode.
-   **🕵️ My Ratings:** Quickly toggle between the global average rating view and your personal, blind rating view.
-   **📤 Upload:** Magic Upload via drag & drop. ComfyUI metadata is extracted automatically.
-   **♻️ Rescan:** Forces a background disk scan for externally added or modified files.

#### Auto-Watch & Refresh

![Auto-Watch popup with Enable Watch toggle and 10 second interval](assets/auto_watch.png)

*Auto-Watch: click the `⋮` next to Refresh, enable the toggle and set an interval. A pulsing red dot confirms it's active.*

-   **Manual Refresh:** Click the 🔃 icon to instantly scan for new files.
-   **Auto-Watch (`⋮`):** Silently scans in the background and injects new ComfyUI files into the grid **without a page reload**. Enable it while ComfyUI is generating to cull in real time.

---

### 3.1.3 Search, Filters & Fuzzy Auto-Suggest

![Advanced search panel showing all filter options](assets/filter_panel.png)

*The Filters panel: search scope, multi-keyword fields, extensions, date range, and options.*

Click **🔍 Filters** to open the advanced search engine. Filters work across both physical Folders and virtual Collections.

**Search Scope:** Current Folder or Global (All Folders). Toggle *Include Subfolders* for recursive search.

**Fuzzy Search & Live Auto-Suggest:**
The **⚙️ Workflow Files** input features alphanumeric normalization (e.g. `wan 2.2` seamlessly matches `wan2.2_i2v_high.safetensors`). As you type, a two-line autocomplete dropdown displays clean filenames alongside folder paths. Native `difflib` string matching provides "Did You Mean?" suggestions when queries yield zero or low results.

**Multi-Keyword Fields** (Workflow Files, Prompt Keywords, Comment Keywords):

| Syntax | Logic | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `,` comma | **AND** — must contain both | `red, car` |
| `;` semicolon | **OR** — contains either | `cat; dog` |
| `!` exclamation | **NOT** — exclude keyword | `!lora`, `!cat` |
| `" "` quotes | **Exact Match** | `"man"` (won't match `woman`) |

*💡 **Pro Tip**: You can combine Exact Matches and Exclusions! Use `!"bad anatomy"` to completely exclude a specific phrase from your search results.*

**Extensions & Prefixes:** Filter by file type or filename prefix.

**Date Range:** Filter by generation/upload date.

**Options:** Favorites Only · No Workflow. 

**Advanced Ratings Filtering:**
Filter feedback by **Star Rating Ranges** (e.g., select '4-5 stars' and '1-2 stars' simultaneously) and by **Specific Raters** to isolate feedback from key clients or team members.

#### Sort Buttons

Sort by **Date** (📅), **Name** (🔤), **Rating** (⭐), or **Comments** (💬). 

Sorting criteria for Ratings and Comments feature sub-menus to effortlessly toggle between "Highest/Lowest Rated", **"Not Rated"**, "Most/Least Discussed", **"Uncommented"**, or **"Newest Comments"**.

---

### 3.1.4 OmniQuery – Search in Plain English

**If you can describe it, you can find it.**  
Press **Ctrl+P** (or **Alt+P**, or the **⚡** toolbar button): a search field opens over a live masonry of your images. Type anything — `girlnextdoor`, `favorite videos from last week`, `seed 424242`, `files rated at least 4 by more than one person` — tiles morph as you type, a local AI answers the free-language questions by querying your database read-only, and Enter opens the results in the gallery. Fully local, sandboxed, no SQL shown.

👉 **[Read the full OmniQuery Guide](docs/OmniQuery.md)** for detailed instructions and examples.

---

### 3.1.5 Gallery Grid & Focus Mode

**Persistent Metadata Hover Bar:** 
Hovering over any image reveals a status bar at the bottom of the screen with exact dimensions, calculated megapixels, file size, and current rating status without needing to open the Lightbox.

**Cluster Badges Toggle:** Enable `🧬 Cluster Badges` in Settings to replace standard green workflow badges on thumbnails with interactive architecture and prompt `#HASH` badges.

**Standard Grid View (Focus Mode OFF):** Hovering reveals the quick-action card with Node Summary (📝), Favorite (⭐), Download (💾), Delete (🗑️). Clicking opens the Lightbox.

![Standard Grid View — Focus Mode OFF, showing hover cards with action buttons](assets/focus_mode_off.png)

**Focus Mode ON (`Q`):** Hides all UI chrome, metadata, titles, and quick-action cards. A golden star marks favorites. Selected items show a massive **fuchsia border**. Use keyboard arrows to navigate. Click or press `V`/`Enter` to open the Lightbox.

![Focus Mode ON — clean grid with fuchsia selection borders](assets/focus_mode_active.png)

> **Power User Tip:** Enable Auto-Watch, activate Focus Mode with `Q`, then use `←→` arrows + `Del`/`F`/`X` to blaze through a batch while it's still generating. Press `I` on any item to view its exact file path, real symlink source target, and node pipeline.

---

### 3.1.6 Batch Selection Bar

Click the checkmark `✓` on any image (or `Space`/`X` in Focus Mode) to select it. The floating **Selection Bar** appears at the bottom.

![Batch selection bar with context menu expanded showing all batch actions](assets/batch_selection_bar.png)

| Action | Shortcut | Description |
|---|---|---|
| ✕ Deselect All | `Esc` | Clears the selection |
| ✅ Select All | `Ctrl+A` | Selects all visible files |
| ↔️ Range Select | — | Appears when exactly 2 files selected; selects all between them |

### 3.2.3 Smart Asset Clustering & Inspector (🧬 / Shortcut <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>)

Smart Asset Clustering organizes your gallery into visual groups based on how your images were created, letting you group and compare images sharing either the same workflow pipeline or the same prompt text.

👉 **[Read the Smart Asset Clustering Manual](docs/Smart_Asset_Clustering_manual.md)**

* **The 2 Clustering Modes:**
  1. **By Architecture (`workflow`):** Groups images created with the exact same workflow setup (node structure + model files), ignoring random seeds, steps, CFG, or prompt text changes.
  2. **By Prompt Text (`prompt`):** Groups images sharing the exact same positive prompt across different models, Flux/SDXL workflows, or settings.
* **Interactive Hash Inspector Modal:**
  Clicking any `#HASH` badge on a thumbnail card opens an **Inspector Panel** showing you:
  * **The Visual Pipeline:** Sequence of color-coded chips (`CheckpointLoader ➔ LoraLoader ➔ KSampler ➔ VAEDecode`).
  * **Models Loaded:** Exact checkpoint and LoRA model files used.
  * **Asset Prompt:** Prompt text with a one-click **📋 Copy** button.
  * **Cluster Stats:** Total matching assets in your library.
  * **One-Click Launch:** A **`🚀 Clusterize Gallery`** button pre-targeted on that asset.
* **Sub-Badges:** When clustering by Prompt, badges display both the primary Prompt badge (`💬 #PROMPT`) and secondary Architecture variant badge (`🧬 #ARCH`).
