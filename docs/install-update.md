### 1. Install

**Option A: Using Git (Recommended)**
```bat
git clone https://github.com/biagiomaf/smart-comfyui-gallery
cd smart-comfyui-gallery
```

**Option B: No Git (Manual Download)**

Download the latest **Source code (zip)** from [**Releases**](https://github.com/biagiomaf/smart-comfyui-gallery/releases/latest), extract it, and open a terminal inside the folder.

**Then, setup the environment:**
```bat
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run (Best Practice)

Create a new file named `run_smartgallery.bat` inside the folder and paste this content.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Replace the example paths with your real paths. Write them however you like — backslashes, forward slashes, a trailing slash, `~`, or the quotes Explorer's "Copy as path" adds are all accepted.
```bat
@echo off
cd /d %~dp0
call venv\Scripts\activate.bat

:: --- CONFIGURATION ---
:: REPLACE these paths with your actual folders.
:: NOTE: Backslashes or forward slashes, either is fine

set "BASE_OUTPUT_PATH=C:/Path/To/ComfyUI/output"
set "BASE_INPUT_PATH=C:/Path/To/ComfyUI/input"
set "BASE_SMARTGALLERY_PATH=C:/Path/To/ComfyUI/output"

:: If ffmpeg is not in your system PATH, point to ffprobe.exe here:
set "FFPROBE_MANUAL_PATH=C:/Path/To/ffmpeg/bin/ffprobe.exe"
set SERVER_PORT=8189

:: --- START ---
python smartgallery.py
pause
```

Double-click `run_smartgallery.bat` to start.

### 3. How to Update

> 🎖️ **Special Thanks**: A huge shout-out to **[Martial Michel](https://github.com/mmartial)** for orchestrating the Docker support and contributing to the core application logic.

Docker deployment provides isolation, easier deployment, and consistent environments across different systems. However, it requires some familiarity with Docker concepts.

**🗄️ Pre-built images**

Pre-built images are available on DockerHub at [mmartial/smart-comfyui-gallery](https://hub.docker.com/r/mmartial/smart-comfyui-gallery) and Unraid's Community Apps.
